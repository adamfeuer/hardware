ADC:
    statistics on a GND and constant (1.5v?) measurement
    comparison of static voltages vs. a multimeter

GENERAL NOISE:
    measurements 
        - scope GND, Vcc, analog, USB data, GPIO output
        - ADC read statistic
    cases
        - GPIO toggling
        - USB read/write
        - USART read/write
        - nothing
        - PWM output

BATTERY:
    reverse voltage

POWER:
    lowest voltage cutout
    power consumption (max)
    reverse 5v on input

PWM:
    test one pin with servo

OTHER:
    serial bootloader button
    button functionality (both)
    measure oscillator frequency at various voltages

JTAG:
    basic flash/debug session
